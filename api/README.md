# WTF?
SpotifyBaton is a PHP class to conduct Spotify in various ways and this is it's REST API extension to make it controllable from anywhere or anything.

From now on, in this readme, SpotifyBaton will refer to the REST API endpoint.
# Usage
Do not - and I _really_ mean it!

This is hastily put together in tremendous pressure just to get something in and out of SpotifyBaton in other projects.

We will rewrite this in the future... maby.
